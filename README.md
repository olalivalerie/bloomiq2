BloomIQ is an intelligent, automated watering and monitoring system designed to keep your plants healthy, vibrant, and thriving — whether in offices, homes, or gardens. Combining IoT technology, environmental sensors, and automation, BloomIQ takes the guesswork out of plant care.

With built-in soil moisture, temperature, and humidity sensors, BloomIQ constantly monitors the environment around your plants. When the soil becomes dry, it automatically activates the watering system, ensuring your flowers and plants always receive the perfect amount of water — no more overwatering or neglect.

Through Wi-Fi and GSM connectivity, BloomIQ connects to an online dashboard (like ThingsBoard), allowing users to monitor real-time plant conditions remotely. It can also send SMS to remind you when your plants need attention even when you’re away.
